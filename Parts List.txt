1 - BS Boards PCB
1 - Elite-C MCU (Low Profile version recommended. I did update the case files to hopefully fit the normal elite-c)
63 - MX switches of your choice
63 - 1n4148 Switching diode 100v 200ma
1 pack- 60% pcb mounted stabalizers
1 - ec11 Rotary encoder or something with similar pinouts to fit the pcb board
2 - 10k ohm resistors for Rotary Encoder
?? - WS2812B 5v LED Strip. I put 28 LEDS in my keyboard but i was able to get 30 LEDs working by reducing the brightness.
1 - 330 ohm resistor (Optional for Leds)
?? - wire of your choice try to find 22 guage and smaller wire for the LEDS


CASE 
Look in "CASE FILES" folder for the eps and dxf files. If using with Ponoko Use ".eps" files.

1 - Switch plate - 1.5mm Aluminum (more detail below please read)
1 - Black Layer - 4.5mm Acrylic (Doesnt have to be black can be any color)
1 - Clear Layer - 4.5mm Acrylic (Again can be any color of your choice)
1 - Back pate - 3mm Acrylic (Color Choice Again)
10 - m2.5x16mm Bolts (I found mine at a local ACE Hardware)
10 - m2.5 hex nuts 


*CASE CONSIDERATIONS*
For the switch plate i recommended 1.5mm aluminum (i think ponoko has 1.6mm aluminum)
you may have to drill a hole where the reset button is on the elite-c controller
i put my elite c on top of the pcb and the bottom of the switch plate was pressing on the reset button.
